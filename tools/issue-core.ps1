# issue-core.ps1 — issue-number-keyed helpers for the commit-msg gate.
# Dot-source this file; do not run it directly.
# Windows PowerShell 5.1-compatible: no ternary, no ??, no &&, no ||.
# Self-contained: no dependency on any other tools/*.ps1 file.

# Resolve-IssueNumber — deterministic, two-source resolution.
#
# 1. Message first: match (#\d+) or any of GitHub's 9 auto-close keywords
#    (close/closes/closed, fix/fixes/fixed, resolve/resolves/resolved)
#    followed by #\d+ (case-insensitive). This is the GitHub auto-close
#    carrier and the per-commit artifact the committer controls.
# 2. Branch fallback: ONLY an anchored mandatory-prefix token
#    (?i)(?:^|[-/])issue[-/](\d+)(?:$|[-/]) so that a branch like
#    enforce/v4-s1-audit-core does NOT resolve (no issue[-/] prefix), and
#    feat/issue-46 DOES resolve to 46. Bare numerals in version strings are
#    never captured.
#
# Returns an int > 0, or 0 if unresolvable.
