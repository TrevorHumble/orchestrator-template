# persist-visual-approval.ps1 — records ONE visual-approval evidence file
# after the owner has explicitly approved a screen in the phase-1 live-preview
# loop (agents/orchestrator.md § "Visual-approval loop").
#
# Honest residual (stated, not hidden): this script is run by the orchestrator
# on the owner's go-ahead, so a determined hand could call it directly with no
# real approval behind it. That is made tamper-EVIDENT, not impossible — the
# owner's bar is tamper-evident, not tamper-proof.
#
# Why the record lives under .review_state/, not inside the visual surface
# itself: .review_state/ is gitignored and entirely OUTSIDE the visual surface
# tools/visual-surface.ps1 defines, so writing this record can never itself
# change the hash it just recorded (the approval record must live outside the
# hashed set so recording it does not void itself).
#
# Windows PowerShell 5.1-compatible: no ternary, no ??, no &&, no ||.
