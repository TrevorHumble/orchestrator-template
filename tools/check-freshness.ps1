# check-freshness: read-only staleness + overlap check, shared by the owner-review
# path (skills/session-brief.md, README.md) and the build-session path
# (.claude/commands/build.md step 0, .claude/commands/realign.md). Build sessions work in isolated worktrees, push
# branches, and merge on GitHub; nothing ever pulls those merges back into
# the primary checkout, so drift can accumulate silently on either side of that
# boundary -- an owner's local main can drift dozens of commits behind
# unnoticed, or a build worktree can be cut from a local main that already
# trails origin/main while a sibling issue has rewritten a file the session
# also edits, so a review passes while it certifies work against an abandoned
# base. This script is the missing signal for both holes. Pure check, no side
# effects on the working tree -- mirrors the shape of tools/assert-worktree.ps1.
# It runs read-only git commands only: `fetch` (updates remote-tracking refs,
# never the working tree), `rev-list --count`, `merge-base`, and
# `diff --name-only`. It never runs pull, merge, checkout, or reset.
#
# Single-homed constants and helpers: the carve-out list and MAX_DRIFT_COMMITS
# threshold are defined ONCE, in this file, and .claude/commands/realign.md
# consumes them from here (the realign command invokes this file's own CLI
# rather than reimplementing the list) -- so nothing else can quietly disagree
# about what counts as a hard collision. Do not copy $CARVE_OUT_PATHS,
# $MAX_DRIFT_COMMITS, Test-CarvedOut, or Get-OverlapFiles into another file;
# extend them here.

  # issue's Touches list, or a wave's combined Touches), as one

  # A single CLI token, not a PowerShell array literal: `powershell -File`
  # passes -File arguments through as literal strings and does not
  # re-tokenize a comma-joined value into an array the way the language
  # parser does inside a script, so an [string[]] param here would silently
  # bind the whole "a,b,c" token as ONE element. Split it ourselves below.
  # When omitted, the branch's own changes since its fork point from
  # origin/main are used instead (git diff --name-only <merge-base>) -- so a
  # bare `check-freshness.ps1` with no arguments still gives a meaningful
  # overlap answer for "what has THIS session changed."

# wrong -- two writers both touching them in the same drift window cannot
# corrupt each other's entries; a merge conflict there is a formatting
# nuisance, not a behavioral collision.

# Membership in THIS SLICE is exactly one path:
#   - BUILDLOG.md (append-only changelog; every entry is a distinct line
#     appended at the end).
# Explicitly OUT of scope for this slice: "governance files" broadly
# (standards/, agents/, DESIGN.md, skills/, .claude/, etc.) are NOT carved

# change), so an overlap there must still raise the flag. A future issue can
