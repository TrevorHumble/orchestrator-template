# new-agent-worktree: give one file-mutating agent its own working directory on
# its own branch, sharing this repo's history via `git worktree add`. Two agent
# sessions sharing a single folder can stash, revert, or switch-branch-under each
# other's uncommitted work -- exactly the failure that hits when two sessions
# (e.g. a dependency-update session and a refactor session) share one folder. One
# working tree, one driver. The commit gate is live in the new worktree with zero
# extra config: core.hooksPath=.githooks is a relative path in shared git config,
# and .githooks/ is a tracked directory, so it resolves to <worktree>/.githooks
# automatically -- this script asserts that rather than assuming it.
#
# Fetch-fresh, always. Cutting a worktree from a local `main` that trails
# `origin/main` -- because nobody ran `git fetch` first -- lets a full
# adversarial review certify work against a base `origin/main` has already
# abandoned. A NEW branch is therefore based on `origin/main` explicitly, never
# on local HEAD: `git fetch` fails loud (never a silent fall-back to whatever
# HEAD happens to be), and `git worktree add -b` names `origin/main` as the
# start point so the new branch is 0 commits behind at birth regardless of how
# stale the primary checkout's local `main` is. An EXISTING branch (the resume
# path) still fetches -- so a later freshness check has a true remote view to
# compare against -- but is checked out as-is, with no rebase/merge/reset:
# resuming a session must never silently rewrite history out from under it.
