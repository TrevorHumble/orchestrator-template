# Spawning an adversarial reviewer

**Protocol:** `standards/adversarial-review-protocol.md` — read it in full before spawning any reviewer.

## De-bias rules (required; no exceptions)

**Give the goal, not the implementation.** State the objective the artifact is judged against. Do not name the mechanisms ("it uses X loop, a Y gate") — that pre-confirms their existence and narrows the review.

**No positive hints.** Never include "the one thing we got right is…" or any framing that pre-establishes a passing area. The reviewer enters assuming everything is bad and discovers what survives.

**Plant no suspicions.** "Suspect X is broken" leads the witness toward a predetermined finding and away from problems you did not anticipate. Say "assume failure, look hard."

**Minimum context — no biasing framing.** Give the artifact + the relevant standard + the protocol, and none of your hopes or explanations. Every additional sentence is a potential bias vector.

**Full scope — list every artifact actually under review.** Anything not listed is itself a finding. Do not give the reviewer a curated subset.

## Spawn-prompt skeleton

Assemble every reviewer spawn prompt from this skeleton — static content first (see the caching section below), volatile artifact last, zero framing:

```text
You are the reviewer agent defined in <path to agents/reviewer-*.md>. Read that
file first and follow it exactly, including its read-only rules.

Standard(s) to judge against: <path to standards/*.md>
Protocol: standards/adversarial-review-protocol.md

Artifact(s) under review (complete list — anything missing from the artifact
itself is a finding):
- <path to artifact, or "the staged diff, tree oid <oid>">

Return your verdict in the output format your agent definition specifies
(verdict token plus numbered defect list with severity and file:line evidence).
```

Nothing else goes in. No goal restatement beyond what the standard already says, no "we focused on X," no suspected weak points, no summary of what the artifact does.

## De-bias is a spawning discipline, not a mechanized gate

There is no separate audit agent or recorded evidence artifact for bias-checking a briefing. Apply the de-bias rules above yourself before every spawn; a reviewer that notices a biased briefing anyway says so in its findings like any other defect.

## No mutation authority (required; no exceptions)

Spawn every reviewer with no mutation authority: use a read-only agent type (`tools: [Read]` or an equivalently narrow read-only set), or, if the reviewer's own spec grants a broader tool set, add an explicit no-mutation instruction to the spawn prompt. A reviewer performs read-only inspection only. Read-only commands (`git show`, `git diff`, `git check-ignore`, `git ls-files`, `npm test`, `format:check`) are permitted. It must not run `git add`, `git reset`, `git restore`, `git checkout`, `git stash`, `git commit`, or `git rm`, and must not edit any file. See `standards/adversarial-review-protocol.md` "Reviewers are read-only" for the rationale — a reviewer that mutates git or files can invalidate the exact staged tree its own verdict is bound to.

## Reviewer count

One reviewer per artifact class — see `standards/adversarial-review-protocol.md` § "Reviewer count by artifact": exactly 1 Opus reviewer for an issue; exactly 1 PR reviewer plus the design-philosophy reviewer for code, both must PASS round 1. The orchestrator may spawn a second independent opinion at its own discretion for a high-stakes or security-flagged change, but there is no standing panel requirement.

## Spawner must never

1. Name suspected weak parts — that leads the witness.
2. Include positive framing or "we tried hard on X."
3. Allow the producing agent to review its own output.
4. Accept a PASS without verifying every cited URL, every `file:line` reference, and every in-scope item has an explicit finding.

## Output contract for the reviewer

Numbered defects, each with severity (blocker / major / minor / nit) and a copy-pasteable fix. Final verdict: **PASS** or **FAIL** — one token, no hedging. PASS with open blockers or majors is not a PASS.

## Re-verify the tree oid before recording a verdict (required; no exceptions)

Before recording any reviewer's verdict, re-run `git write-tree` and confirm the resulting oid still equals the oid the review was bound to at spawn time. If the oid changed, the staged tree was mutated mid-review — the review is invalid regardless of the verdict returned and must be redone against a freshly captured tree. Do not record a PASS or a FAIL for a tree whose oid no longer matches.

## Stable-prefix structure for prompt caching

**Step-1 finding:** Anthropic's public docs describe prompt caching at the API level via `cache_control` breakpoints (explicit per-block placement, up to 4 per request) or a top-level automatic mode that applies a breakpoint to the last cacheable block and advances it as context grows. Claude Code's Task tool manages spawn context internally and does not publicly document a manual `cache_control` knob for subagents. Therefore: treat caching as automatic-where-supported, do not add explicit breakpoints in Task spawn prompts, and CONFIRM EMPIRICALLY via `cache_read_input_tokens` in the response usage field rather than assuming a cache hit occurred.

The lever we control is ordering: place the static standard(s) and protocol as the first content in every spawn prompt, and put the volatile artifact (the diff, the skill draft, the issue text) after it. The volatile artifact is always billed fresh.

**Precondition:** prompt caching only activates above a model-dependent minimum cached-prefix size. Below that minimum, no caching occurs and the ordering discipline has zero effect. Keep the static standards prefix above this minimum; treat the ordering benefit as conditional on meeting it. Do not rely on a fixed token count — consult current model documentation. (Example minimums as of 2026-06-16: 1,024 tokens for Claude Sonnet 4.6; 4,096 tokens for Claude Haiku 4.5.)

Caching changes ordering only, not the content any reviewer receives.

**Guardrail — content hash:** cache validity is tied to the exact bytes of the cached prefix. When the prefix is cached, any edit to the standards bytes invalidates it (a cache miss) on the next spawn. Before each pipeline run, record the content hash of every standards file passed as a prefix. If the hash changes mid-run, the cached prefix is stale and the next spawn will re-prime the cache — automatically if automatic caching is in effect; only if `cache_control` were re-added in explicit mode (not currently required for Task-spawned subagents; see finding above).

**TTL:** the default cache lifetime is 5 minutes, refreshed at no charge each time cached content is used. An extended 1-hour TTL option exists at additional cost (2× the base write price vs. 1.25× for the default).

**Cache-read pricing:** cache reads bill at 10% of the base input token price.

**Verification:** after a repeat spawn, inspect the response's usage field. A non-zero `cache_read_input_tokens` value confirms the stable prefix was served from cache rather than re-billed.
